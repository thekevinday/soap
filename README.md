# Soap

A collection of soap recipes created by Kevin Day, made available under the CC-By-SA 4.0 license.

Each soap recipe has a common name, such as "Alpha", which is associated with an identification version number.

The identification version numbers are based on on major.minor.micro such that:
- major = soap recipe identification number (generally the order in which they were created).
- minor = specific implementation of recipe (distinguishes alternative versions).
- micro = specific revision of a recipe.

Each recipe has a "Last Updated" date, which represents when the recipe was last updated.
Layout changes or calculation fixes are not applied to the "Last Updated" as these are not recipe changes.

In addition, there is a Quick Reference chart that can be used as a cheat sheet for guestimating Lye to Oil mixtures based on volume/container instead of weight.
